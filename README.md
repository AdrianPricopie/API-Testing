### Getting started
This is where the magic begins! The following steps will help you to get started with your journey towards creating some awesome music apps using the API:
 Log into the dashboard using your Spotify account.
 Create an app and select "Web API" for the question asking which APIs are you planning to use. Once you have created your app, you will have access to the app credentials. These will be required for API 
 authorization to obtain an access token.
 Use the access token in your API requests.
